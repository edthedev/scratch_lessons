# Lesson 1: Scribble Bug!

![Scribble Bug Intro Picture](ScribbleBug.png)

Teach Scribble bug how to follow your mouse while he scribbles in fun colors.

## Bug

- If you want to, use the sprite library to change the cat into a bug, or some other animal.
- The links at the left are sets of pictures. The bug I chose is in the *Animals* set.

## Teach the Scribble Bug with Scratch Code

Add the following code to your sprite.

![Scribble Bug Code](ScribbleBugCode.png)

The blocks we want are:
- *when Green Flag clicked* ![green flag](whengreenflagclicked.png)
- *pen down* 
![Pen Down](pendown.png)
- *forever*
![Forever](forever.png)
- *point towards*
![Point Toward](pointtowardsmousepointer.png)
- *change pen shade by 10*
![Pen color by 10](changepenshadeby10.png)
- *move 10 steps*

![Scripts Pen](Pen.png)

![Pen Down](pendown.png)

*Pen Down* is a *Pen* script. Find it in the *Pen* section. You may need to scroll down in the scripts window. It tells Scribble Bug to touch the pen down to the page.

![Scripts Control](Control2.png)

![Forever](forever.png)

*Forever* is a *Control* script. Find it in the *Control* section. It will make the commands inside repeat forever. You will use it to make Scribble Bug follow 
your mouse forever.

![Scripts Motion](Motion.png)

![Point Toward](pointtowardsmousepointer.png)

*Point Toward* is a *Motion* script. You will use it to tell Scribble Bug to point toward your mouse pointer. Since it goes inside the *Forever* script, Scribble Bug will point toward your mouse forever.

![Scripts Pen](Pen.png)

![Pen shade by 10](changepencolorby10.png)

*Change pen shade by 10* is another *Pen* script. It tells scribble bug to change its pen color just a little bit. Since it goes inside the *Forever* script, Scribble Bug will draw a rainbow line!

![Scripts Motion](Motion.png)

![Move 10 steps](move10steps.png)

*Move 10 steps* is another *Motion* script. It tell scribble bug to move forward a little bit. Since it goes inside the *Forever* script, Scribble Bug will always move forward. If we forgot this command, Scribble Bug would forget to move.

## Assemble

Now that you have all the parts, here's the way to assemble them, again.
