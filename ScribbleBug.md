# Lesson 1: Scribble Bug!

![Scribble Bug Intro Picture](img/ScribbleBug.png)

Teach Scribble bug how to follow your mouse while he scribbles in fun colors.

## Bug

- If you want to, use the sprite library to change the cat into a bug, or some other animal.
- The links at the left are sets of pictures. The bug I chose is in the *Animals* set.

## Teach the Scribble Bug with Scratch Code

The following code blocks will make your bug move.
First we will find each block.
Then we will put them together like this:

## Find the blocks we need

The blocks we need are:
- ![green flag](img/whengreenflagclicked.png) *when Green Flag clicked* 
- ![Pen Down](img/pendown.png) *pen down* 
- ![Forever](img/forever.png) *forever*
- ![Point Toward](img/pointtowardsmousepointer.png) *point towards moust pointer*
- ![Pen color by 10](img/changepencolorby10.png) *change pen color by 10*
- ![Move 10 steps](img/move10steps.png) *move 10 steps*

### 1 Event Block

![Scripts Event](img/events.png)

![green flag](img/whengreenflagclicked.png) 

*when Green Flag clicked* is an *Event* block. Find it in the *Events* section. It tells Scribble Bug when to get started.

### 2 Pen Blocks

![Scripts Pen](img/pen.png)

![Pen Down](img/pendown.png)

*Pen Down* is a *Pen* script. Find it in the *Pen* section. You may need to scroll down in the scripts window. It tells Scribble Bug to touch the pen down to the page.

![Pen shade by 10](img/changepencolorby10.png)

*Change pen shade by 10* is another *Pen* script. It tells scribble bug to change its pen color just a little bit. Since it goes inside the *Forever* script, Scribble Bug will draw a rainbow line!

### 1 Control Block

![Scripts Control](img/control2.png)

![Forever](img/forever.png)

*Forever* is a *Control* script. Find it in the *Control* section. It will make the commands inside repeat forever. You will use it to make Scribble Bug follow 
your mouse forever.

### 2 Motion Blocks

![Scripts Motion](img/motion.png)

![Point Toward](img/pointtowardsmousepointer.png)

*Point Toward* is a *Motion* script. You will use it to tell Scribble Bug to point toward your mouse pointer. Since it goes inside the *Forever* script, Scribble Bug will point toward your mouse forever.

![Move 10 steps](img/move10steps.png)

*Move 10 steps* is another *Motion* script. It tell scribble bug to move forward a little bit. Since it goes inside the *Forever* script, Scribble Bug will always move forward. If we forgot this command, Scribble Bug would forget to move.

## Assemble

Now that you have all the parts, here's the way to assemble them, again.
